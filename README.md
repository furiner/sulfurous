## What is this?

Sulfurous is a framework built for making scalable web applications with a modular and open architecture. It uses the latest technologies (e.g <a href="https://typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>) for a modern and fast development experience. It is built with the goal of being a framework that can be used for any project, from small to large, and can be used for any purpose, from a simple API to a full-fledged web application; all with the same framework and elements that can be used in any way you want.

To reach this goal, all of hte performance optimizations are made at a web server level, utilizing the best possible techniques to make the most out of the resources provided while still giving the same experience regardless of the size of the project, or its approach.

**Primarily**, the end goals and features of this framework is:
* Clean and easy to use architecture, as well as a modular routing system;
* A fast and immense focus on performance and scalability, with possible statistics and stress testing against other frameworks;
* The addition of important helpers and integrations for common tasks and needs;
* A high quality and well-documented codebase;
* Great coverage of all of the features through solid unit testing;
* A complete myriad of third-party support for plugins that are available.

### Philosophy

The core philosophy of Sulfurous is to provide a robust and extensive solution for websites, single-page applications, and REST APIs. While there are a lot of proficient and amazing libraries people have made for Node.js, there is an extensive lack of proper tools and frameworks that can be used to build a complete web application without the need of external libraries.

Sulfurous aims to resolve these problems, while maintaining it's high level scope of what's necessary for it to function well.
